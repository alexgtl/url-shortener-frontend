          Recently, I embarked on a journey to create something cool, and voila, I present to you my latest creation –
          an awesome URL shortener app! 🚀 What makes it stand out? Well, it's not just your average link shrinker; it
          always points to the www.alexgutierrez.dev domain, adding a personal touch to every link you share. Built with
          the dynamic duo of Nuxt and Express.js, spiced up with the goodness of TypeScript, this stack ensures a smooth
          and robust experience. The frontend tools in the mix add that extra flair, making the user interface sleek and
          intuitive. So, whether you're sharing your latest project or just want to impress your friends with snappy
          links, give it a spin! 🌐✨
