# alexgutierrez.link URL Shortener

Hey there! Welcome to my URL shortener project, hosted under the domain alexgutierrez.link. ðŸš€

## What's This Project About?

Well, it's a URL shortener! You know, those handy tools that take long, unwieldy URLs and turn them into something short and sweet. Perfect for sharing on social media, in emails, or just to tidy up your links.

## Tech Stack

For this project, I've used some awesome technologies:

- **Nuxt**: It's a Vue.js framework that makes building Vue applications super fast and easy. Plus, it's great for SEO!
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript, making our code more predictable and easier to debug. No more surprises!
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that gives us superpowers when it comes to styling. With Tailwind, we can build beautiful designs quickly without writing a ton of custom CSS.

## How to Use

Using the URL shortener is a piece of cake:

1. Just head over to [alexgutierrez.link](https://alexgutierrez.link).
2. Paste your long URL into the input field.
3. Click the "Shorten" button.
4. VoilÃ ! You'll get a nice, short URL that you can share with the world.
